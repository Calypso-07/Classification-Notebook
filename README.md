# Classification-Notebook

In this notebook I used several methods to make the data given cleaner and better for using to train my model. I used z-score to find outliers, I replaced the infinite values with NaN's and filled in the null data with mean values.I used corralation matrix and feature plots to further understand and visualize the train data. Then I used the training set to train three algoritms, compare each of them, and pick the model that gives a closer prediction to our target, which in this case was XGBoost Classifier.
